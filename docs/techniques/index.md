## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Guidelines

!!! warning "Responsible Use"
    
    All techniques documented here are for:
    
    - **Authorized Testing**: Only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
    - **Educational Purpose**: Learning and improving defensive security
    - **Bug Bounty Programs**: Following program-specific rules and scope
    - **Defensive Research**: Understanding attack vectors for better protection
    
    **Never use these techniques for:**
    - Unauthorized access to systems
    - Malicious activities or criminal purposes
    - Violating terms of service or laws
    - Harming individuals or organizations

## üìä Technique Effectiveness

Techniques are rated based on:
- **Success Rate**: How often the technique yields results
- **Detection Risk**: Likelihood of triggering security controls
- **Skill Level**: Required expertise to execute effectively
- **Tool Dependency**: Reliance on specific tools or configurations

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

- **Regular Updates**: Keep techniques current with evolving technology
- **Community Feedback**: Incorporate improvements from practitioners
- **New Research**: Add emerging attack vectors and methodologies
- **Tool Evolution**: Update tool recommendations and configurations
