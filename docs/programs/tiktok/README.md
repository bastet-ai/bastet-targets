# TikTok - HackerOne Bounty Program

**Program URL**: https://hackerone.com/tiktok  
**Primary Domain**: tiktok.com  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-01  
**Risk Level**: ðŸ”¥ MEDIUM-HIGH  

## Program Overview

TikTok operates a significant bug bounty program focused on securing their global short-form video platform. The program demonstrates consistent engagement with the security research community and regular bounty awards.

## Historical Activity (6-month window)

- **Total Payouts**: $6,000.00 (Rank #4)
- **Reports Resolved**: 12
- **Average Per Report**: $500.00
- **Activity Pattern**: Regular bounty activity throughout August 2025
- **Focus Areas**: Mobile app security, API endpoints, content delivery

## Attack Surface Analysis (2025-09-01)

### Discovered Infrastructure
- **Subdomains Identified**: 9 active subdomains
- **Live Web Services**: 10 responsive endpoints
- **Primary Attack Vectors**: API services, authentication flows, support systems

### Key Subdomains
| Subdomain | Purpose | Security Notes |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `api.tiktok.com` | API Gateway | Dedicated API infrastructure |
| `login.tiktok.com` | Authentication | Extensive endpoint exposure |
| `support.tiktok.com` | Customer Support | Support backend accessible |
| `test.tiktok.com` | Development | Test environment exposed |
| `www.tiktok.com` | Main Platform | Primary application endpoint |

### Critical Findings
1. **API Infrastructure**: Dedicated `api.tiktok.com` subdomain with broad surface area
2. **Authentication Surface**: `login.tiktok.com` exposes multiple sensitive endpoints
3. **Support System Access**: Customer service backend potentially accessible
4. **Development Leakage**: Test environment externally reachable
5. **Endpoint Enumeration**: Multiple services respond to common path probing

### Security Analysis
- **API Gateway**: Centralized API management via dedicated subdomain
- **Authentication Service**: Separate login service with extensive endpoints
- **Support Infrastructure**: Customer service systems discoverable
- **Development Environment**: Test systems accessible for analysis

## Scope Snapshot (as of 2025-09-01)

See [scope.md](scope.md) for full policy text and breakdown.

### Key Focus Areas
- Mobile application security (iOS/Android apps)
- Web platform vulnerabilities
- API security and abuse prevention
- Content delivery network security
- User data protection

## Research Priorities

### Phase 1 - API Security Assessment
- [ ] API endpoint comprehensive enumeration
- [ ] Authentication and authorization bypass testing
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention analysis
- [ ] Mobile API vs web API differences

### Phase 2 - Authentication Flow Analysis
- [ ] Login service deep-dive analysis
- [ ] Session management review
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication bypass
- [ ] Social login integration security

### Phase 3 - Platform-Specific Vectors
- [ ] Video upload and processing pipeline
- [ ] Content moderation bypass techniques
- [ ] User-generated content XSS/injection
- [ ] Mobile app specific vulnerabilities

## Notes & Intelligence

- **Mobile Focus**: Primary application is mobile-first with web interface
- **API-Driven**: Heavy reliance on API services for all functionality
- **Global Scale**: Massive user base requires robust security measures
- **Content Platform**: Unique attack vectors around user-generated content

### Technical Observations
- Dedicated API infrastructure suggests microservices architecture
- Separate authentication service indicates complex identity management
- Support system exposure may provide administrative access vectors
- Test environment accessibility creates information disclosure risks

### Recent Activity Patterns
- Consistent bounty awards in August 2025
- Focus on API and authentication vulnerabilities
- Mobile security research prioritized
- Regular program policy updates
