# Archived Programs

This section contains documentation for completed, paused, or discontinued bounty programs that are no longer under active research.

!!! note "Archive Purpose"
    Archived programs serve as valuable references for:
    
    - Historical vulnerability patterns
    - Methodology documentation
    - Timeline analysis
    - Lessons learned
