Overview
MediaTek takes security concerns and vulnerabilities extremely seriously, and always seeks to respond appropriately to reports.
If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in our products, please report it to us by following the instructions here: https://corp.mediatek.com/security-contact
MediaTek is currently running a private and invite-only bug bounty program on HackerOne since 2021. We will invite researchers to this private program if they have a record of submitting high-quality reports to "security@mediatek.com".
If you have previously submitted some high-quality reports and are interested in joining this exclusive program, please directly reach out to "security@mediatek.com". The MediaTek Security Team will review your eligibility for joining this program.
Please note that only reports submitted through our bug bounty program on HackerOne are eligible for monetary rewards.
We will respond and investigate all vulnerability reports submitted to us and will work with researchers to address the vulnerabilities.
When conducting any testing, please make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, disruption to production environment, and destruction or manipulation of data. All information about the security issue discovered must also remain in confidence and private during the coordinated vulnerability disclosure time frame.
