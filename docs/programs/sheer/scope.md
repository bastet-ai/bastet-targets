Overview
Last updated on February 26, 2025. View changes 
While we are doing our best to keep Sheer as safe as possible, we know that some bugs can slip trough our scrutiny.
If you believe you've found a security issue in the services listed in our scope, we will work with you to resolve it promptly and ensure you are fairly rewarded for your discovery.
Scope
The scope of this program is limited to security vulnerabilities found on Sheer. Vulnerabilities reported on other properties or applications are currently not eligible for monetary reward. High impact vulnerabilities outside of this scope might be considered on a case by case basis.

Reward
Sheer may provide rewards to eligible reporters of qualifying vulnerabilities. Rewards amounts vary depending upon the severity of the vulnerability reported.
Sheer keeps the right to decide if the minimum severity threshold is met and whether the scope of the reported bug is actually already covered by a previously reported vulnerability. Rewards are granted entirely at the discretion of Sheer. To qualify for a reward under this program, you should respect all the below criterias.
Eligibility and Responsible Disclosure
We are happy to work with everyone who submits valid reports which help us improve the security of Sheer.
However, only those that meet the following eligibility requirements may receive a monetary reward:
You need to be the first person to report an unknown issue
Any vulnerability found must be reported no later than 24 hours after discovery.
You are not allowed to disclose details about the vulnerability anywhere else.
You must avoid tests that could cause degradation or interruption of our service.
You must not leak, manipulate, or destroy any user data.
You are only allowed to test against accounts you own yourself.
The use of automated tools or scripted testing is not allowed
You must not be a former or current Sheer employee.
Send a clear textual description of the report along with steps to reproduce the vulnerability, include attachments such as screenshots or proof of concept code as necessary.
Disclose the vulnerability report exclusively through HackerOne.
Becareful, if your report requires the use of Burp Suite, there is a high chance that it is invalid. To avoid receiving a heavy penalty for a report classified as Invalid, please double-check multiple times that it is not a local hack (self-hack).
A good bug report should include the following information at a minimum:
List the URL and any affected parameters
Describe the browser, OS, and/or app version
Describe the perceived impact. How could the bug potentially be exploited?
We intend to respond and resolve reported issues as quickly as possible. This means that you will receive progress updates from us at least every five working days.
Note that posting details or conversations about the report or posting details that reflect negatively on the program and the Sheer brand, will result in immediate disqualification from the program.
