Disclosure Policy
It is prohibited to discuss this program or any vulnerabilities (even resolved ones) outside of the program without explicit consent from the organization.
Follow HackerOne's disclosure guidelines.
Program Rules
Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue will not be eligible for a reward.
Submit one vulnerability per report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact.
When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).
Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.
Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited.
Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction or mass exfiltration of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.
Zooplus is in the EU and some services are only made available in Europe through Geo IP. To avoid problems in your test, please use a VPN with an exit node in a country in the EU.
Test Plan
Load-intensive scans should be avoided.

Out of scope vulnerabilities
When reporting vulnerabilities, please consider (1) attack scenario / exploitability, and (2) security impact of the bug. The following issues are considered out of scope:
Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a user's device.
Previously known vulnerable libraries without a working Proof of Concept.
Content spoofing and text injection issues without showing an attack vector/without being able to modify HTML/CSS
Missing best practices in Content Security Policy.
Missing email best practices (only Invalid, incomplete or missing DKIM/DMARC records)
Public Zero-day vulnerabilities that have had an official patch for less than 1 month will be awarded on a case by case basis.
Open redirect - unless an additional security impact can be demonstrated
Self-XSS are out of scope if could not be chained with another kind of attack that not require social engineering.
Social media account takeover" findings can be only rewarded once, as the we have tens of millions of pages needing checks. We'd appreciate it if all found links to accounts are provided in one ticket.
Only accept users leaks that include Z+ Employees or 3rd party credentials, like logistics companies. Accounts from voting pools, Kanban boards and other kind of tools used by developers under their own reason are not part of that, unless internal Z+ information is leaked thru it. We also accept leaks from Z+ customers only if comes from leaks generated IN zooplus, or other of the domains in the program, site, of course the way that this leak was obtained must be included in the report. We do not accept leaks obtained with virus, trojans, browser leaks.... directly from the customers as is not a Z+ Leak. Of course we appreciate any report of that as a good faith from all the community and we always tried to be as gratefull as company policies allowed us.
We could not accept TLD reports that are not associated with our organization or not reserved by our business as security risk.
