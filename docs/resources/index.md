## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Foundation

Security research must be conducted within ethical and legal boundaries:

### Core Principles

1. **Authorization**: Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
2. **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
3. **Minimal Impact**: Avoid causing harm or disruption to systems or users
4. **Privacy Respect**: Protect user data and personal information
5. **Legal Compliance**: Follow all applicable laws and regulations

### Research Ethics Checklist

- [ ] **Permission Verified**: Confirmed authorization to test the target
- [ ] **Scope Understood**: Clear understanding of what is in/out of scope
- [ ] **Impact Assessed**: Evaluated potential impact of testing activities
- [ ] **Disclosure Plan**: Prepared responsible disclosure procedure
- [ ] **Documentation Ready**: Ability to provide clear evidence and reproduction steps
